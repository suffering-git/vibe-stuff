### **Project Scope Document: YouTube Channel Data Scraper & Processor**

#### **Project Overview**

The project aims to create a robust system for downloading all video transcripts and comments from specified YouTube channels. The collected raw data will then be processed by the Gemini API for refinement and analysis. The final, processed data will be stored in a scalable solution and be accessible through a suite of user-friendly querying functions.

#### **Core Functionalities**

*   **Data Extraction:**
    *   Download all video transcripts for an entire YouTube channel.
    *   Download all comments for all videos on a YouTube channel.
*   **Networking & Performance:**
    *   Utilize Webshare proxies to prevent IP bans during extensive data scraping.
    *   Employ asynchronous programming to enhance the speed and efficiency of data extraction.
*   **Data Processing & Storage:**
    *   Securely manage API keys and proxy credentials using a `.env` file.
    *   Leverage the Gemini API to programmatically select and refine the raw transcript and comment data.
    *   Implement a data integrity mechanism to prevent corruption in case of crashes during execution.
*   **Content Updates:**
    *   Periodically scan previously processed channels to detect and download new video content (transcripts and comments).
*   **Data Querying:**
    *   Develop a set of user-friendly functions for querying and analyzing the final processed data.

#### **Technical Stack**

*   **Programming Language:** Python
*   **APIs:**
    *   `youtube_transcript_api` (for video transcripts)
    *   YouTube Data API v3 (for comments and channel video lists)
    *   Gemini API (for data processing)
*   **Networking:** Webshare Proxies
*   **Configuration:** Python `dotenv` for managing environment variables.

#### **Implementation Outline**

1.  **Setup:** Initialize the project environment, including setting up the `.env` file for API keys and proxy credentials.
2.  **Channel Scraper:** Develop a module to fetch a complete list of video IDs for a given YouTube channel.
3.  **Transcript Downloader:** Implement a function to download transcripts for a list of video IDs using `youtube_transcript_api`.
4.  **Comment Downloader:** Implement a function to download comments for a list of video IDs using the YouTube Data API v3, managing API quotas carefully.
5.  **Proxy & Async Integration:** Integrate proxy usage into all API requests and refactor the downloaders to run asynchronously for improved performance.
6.  **Initial Processing:** Create a script that sends the raw, downloaded text data to the Gemini API for initial cleaning, summarization, and structuring.
7.  **Data Storage:** Implement a solution to store the processed data.
8.  **Update Mechanism:** Build a function that checks channels for new videos since the last scan and runs the download/processing pipeline on them.
9.  **Query Interface:** Develop a library of functions that allow a user to easily retrieve and work with the stored data.

<font color="blue">Based on your notes, I have identified a few areas where more specific decisions could be beneficial. Please review the following suggestions and respond with "yes" or "no" for each.</font>
<font color="blue">1. For initial data storage, should we save the raw, unprocessed data as individual JSON files (one per video) before any processing occurs? This creates a durable backup of the raw data before it's transformed.</font>
<font color="blue">2. To prevent data corruption from crashes, should the system write data to a temporary file first and only move it to its final destination after the download and initial processing for a video is 100% complete?</font>
<font color="blue">3. For the final, processed data, do you agree that we should use a local SQLite database? It's a simple, file-based database that is easy to set up and query, making it a good starting point before potentially moving to a larger database solution.</font>
<font color="blue">4. To handle channel updates efficiently, should the system store a list of all processed video IDs per channel? When checking for updates, it would fetch all video IDs from the channel and only download data for those not already in its list, which is more reliable than using timestamps.</font>
<font color="blue">5. Since you have no experience with testing, should we add a basic testing framework like `pytest` and start by writing simple tests for non-API functions first (e.g., functions that format data or handle files) to build familiarity?</font>
