some files from my last 2 weeks of progression of learning context engineering

i was a noob coder before this, taught myself python like 5-7 years ago, never did much with it, no professional experience, you could learn what i knew in like 2 weeks legit

files are prefixed in chronological-ish order - as you can see things get less scuffed as you learnðŸ¤£a lot of it is your environment/workflow honestly so the headache of setting that shit up real nice is worth it

to quickly see before/after:

  - before: 03_v000001_test_opener_response.md
  - after: 12_vCURRENT.md

at some point i read this article and watched the videos in it and it was clear that context engineering is like the big boy version of vibe coding: https://inferencebysequoia.substack.com/p/vibe-coding-needs-context-engineering

the Code Medin video featuring Rasmus' context engineering repo is like the REAL big boy version of it but that shit is too much for me xD, very powerful, but like very verbose, hard to keep track of if ur not already a professional developer i guess
